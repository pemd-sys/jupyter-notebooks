    "The buck converter is a simple power electronics converter for reducing the dc voltage, using only non dissipative switches, inductors, and capacitors. The output voltage is not isolated i.e., the input and the output share a common terminal (DC-). \n",
    "\n",
    "The switch produces a rectangular waveform vs(t) as illustrated below. The voltage vs(t) is equal to the dc input voltage Vg when the switch is in position 1, and is equal to zero when the switch is in position 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "The switching frequency fs, equal to the inverse of the switching period Ts, generally lies in the range of 1 kHzâ€“1 MHz, depending on the switching speed of the semiconductor devices. Some integrated switch buck converter offerings from TI goes even higher to 2.5 MHz.\n"
